# Test Battle Code

## This program simulates a text based turn based battle against one opponent, controlled by the computer, with the template to make more unique enemies.

## I created this program to test and better understand how to create a combat encounter in a video game.

## In order to run this project you need to download the file "Final Project".

## I am most proud of the enemy's code on their turn. Every turn it uses a random action, and as it gets weaker it uses stronger actions and gains access to more actions overall.

## Enter a name for your character, then follow the prompts in the code by entering numbers(1-5) to use the program. Everything was built and tested using JUnit4.
